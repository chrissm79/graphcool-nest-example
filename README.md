# typescript-advanced

ðŸš€ Advanced starter code for a scalable, production-ready GraphQL server written in TypeScript, including authentication and realtime functionality with GraphQL subscriptions.

## Features

- **Scalable GraphQL Server:** `graphql-yoga` based on Apollo Server & Express
- **GraphQL-native database:** Includes GraphQL database binding to Graphcool (running on MySQL)
- Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground) & [Tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)
- Simple data model â€“ easy to adjust
- Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-config) setup
- Authentication based on email & password
- Realtime functionality with GraphQL subscriptions (_coming soon_)

## Requirements

You need to have the following things installed:

* Node 8+ & TypeScript
* GraphQL CLI: `npm i -g graphql-cli`
* GraphQL Playground desktop app (optional): [Download](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground/releases)

## Getting started

```sh
# Bootstrap GraphQL server in directory `my-app`, based on `typescript-advanced` boilerplate
graphql create my-app --boilerplate typescript-advanced

# choose the Graphcool cluster you want to deploy to

# Navigate to the new project
cd my-app

# Start server (runs on http://localhost:4000)
yarn start

# Open Playground to explore GraphQL API
yarn playground
```

## Docs

### Commands

* `yarn start` starts GraphQL server
* `yarn debug` starts GraphQL server in debug mode (open [chrome://inspect/#devices](chrome://inspect/#devices) to debug)
* `yarn playground` opens the GraphQL Playground
* `yarn graphcool` access to local version of `graphcool` CLI

### Project structure

#### `/` - configuration files

- [`.env`](./.env) Contains important environment variables for development. Read about how it works [here](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).
- [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](./.graphqlconfig.yml) GraphQL configuration file containing the endpoints and schema configuration. Used by the [`graphql-cli`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-cli) and the [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground). See [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-config) for more information.

#### `/database` - datamodel

- [`database/graphcool.yml`](./database/graphcool.yml) The configuration file for your database service ([documentation](https://www.graph.cool/docs/1.0/reference/graphcool.yml/overview-and-example-foatho8aip)).
- [`database/datamodel.graphql`](./database/datamodel.graphql) contains the data model that you define for your database service (written in [SDL](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51)).

#### `/src` - application server

- [`src/schema.graphql`](src/schema.graphql) defines your **application schema**. It contains the GraphQL API that you want to expose to your client applications.
- [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) is the entry point of your server, putting everything together and starting the `GraphQLServer` from [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga).
- [`src/resolvers/`](src/resolvers) contains the actual business logic of your application. In GraphQL, you implement [resolver functions](http://graphql.org/learn/execution/) that *resolve* a specific query being requested.

#### `/src/generated` - generated files

- [`src/generated/graphcool.graphql`](src/generated/graphcool.graphql) defines the **database schema**. It contains the GraphQL API exposed by the Graphcool Database. This file is automatically generated every time `graphcool deploy` is executed, according to the datamodel in `database/datamodel.graphql`.
- [`src/generated/graphcool.ts`](src/generated/graphcool.ts) static TypeScript type definitions for `graphcool-binding`, enabling autocompletion in your IDE. This file is automatically generated using `graphql prepare` every time `graphcool deploy` is executed.

### Common questions

#### I'm getting a 'Schema could not be fetched.' error after deploying, what gives?

Access to the Graphcool API is secured by a secret. This also applies to the introspection query. Using the latest version of GraphQL Playground, the `Authorization` header should automatically be setup with a proper JWT signing the secret. If that's not the case, you can follow these steps to access your API:

1. Visit http://jwtbuilder.jamiekurtz.com/
1. Replace the `Key` at the bottom of the page with [your secret from the `.env` file](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-boilerplate/blob/master/.env#L3)
1. Click `Create signed JWT` and copy the obtained token
1. Now, to access the schema, use the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, or in the GraphQL Playground set it as JSON:
    ```json
    {
      "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
    }
    ```
1. Reload the schema in the Playground (the _refresh_-button is located right next to the URL of the server)

> Note: Currently, no content of the signed JWT is verified by the database! This will be implemented [according to this proposal](https://github.com/graphcool/framework/issues/1365) at a later stage.
